# Reasoning

Okay, I need to create a Java console application for managing seat assignments on an Airbus A350-900. The user wants the code to use Lombok to reduce boilerplate and SLF4J for logging instead of System.out.println. Let me start by breaking down the requirements.

First, the main features required are initializing the seating plan, assigning seats, making reservations, changing assignments, and displaying availability. The initial focus is on F01, which is initializing the seating plan with the correct classes, rows, and seat arrangements.

The Airbus A350-900 has different classes: Economy, Premium Economy, Business, and maybe First. I should check the actual seat configuration. Wait, the A350-900 typically has Business, Premium Economy, and Economy. Let me confirm: Business class might be in the front with lie-flat seats, Premium Economy in the middle, and Economy at the rear. Each class has specific rows and seat arrangements.

For example, Business class might have rows 1-10, with a 1-2-1 configuration. Premium Economy could be rows 11-20, 2-4-2, and Economy rows 21-50, 3-3-3. I need to model these sections accurately.

The seating plan should be generated on startup. So I need a class structure that represents the aircraft, sections, rows, and seats. Using Lombok's @Data or @Value for immutable classes might help. Also, enums for seat status (available, reserved, etc.) and seat class.

I need to avoid boilerplate, so using Lombok's annotations like @Getter, @Setter, @AllArgsConstructor, etc., where appropriate. For example, a Seat class might have row number, seat letter, status, and class.

The main application should initialize the seating plan when it starts. The user mentioned using SLF4J for logging, so I'll need a Logger instance in each class where logging is needed.

Wait, the user said to avoid System.out.println and use SLF4J. So all user interactions in the console should be via the logger? That might not be right. Wait, no. The logging is for the application's internal messages, but the actual user interaction (menus, prompts) would still need to use System.out or similar, right? But the user specified to avoid System.out.println and use SLF4J. Hmm, maybe the output to the user is via the logger. That's a bit unusual because typically logs are for debugging/record-keeping, but user interaction is through console in/out. But the requirement says to avoid System.out.println, so perhaps all messages to the user are logged via SLF4J. That might complicate things because the user would see log messages instead of a clean interface. Maybe the user intends that any status messages (like seat assignments) should be logged, but the actual user prompts might still need to use System.in and System.out. But the requirement says to avoid System.out.println. This is a bit confusing. Maybe the user wants all output, including user interaction, to go through the logger. But how would that work in a console app? Because the logger typically writes to a file or console, but not as part of the interactive prompts. Hmm. Maybe I need to clarify, but since I can't ask, I'll proceed as per the requirement: use SLF4J for all output, so no System.out.println. So all messages to the user are logged as info or something. But how does the user input work then? The input would still be via Scanner or System.in, but the output is via logger. That might make the user experience a bit odd, but perhaps that's acceptable for this exercise.

So moving on. The seating plan initialization: create a list of sections, each with their rows and seat layout. The SeatPlan class could have a list of SeatSection. Each SeatSection has a class type (Business, etc.), start and end rows, and seat arrangement per row.

For example, Business class (rows 1-10) has a seat arrangement like ["A", "B", "C", "D"], but with a 1-2-1 configuration, which would mean that each row has seats A, C, D, F, or something. Wait, maybe the seat arrangement is defined by the number of seats per row and their letters. Alternatively, the arrangement could be a pattern like for each row, the seats are arranged in a certain way. For example, in Business, each row might have seats A, B, C, D, but arranged in a 1-2-1 layout. But for simplicity, perhaps the exact letters don't matter, just the number of seats per row. Or maybe we can model the seat letters based on typical configurations.

Alternatively, perhaps each row in a section has a certain number of seats, with letters assigned accordingly. For example, Economy 3-3-3 would have seats A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, but grouped as ABC, DEF, GHI. But maybe for this program, the exact letters aren't critical as long as each seat is uniquely identified by row and seat letter.

Wait, the problem says "seat rows and arrangement are taken into account". So I need to model the actual seat layout. For example, Business might have seats in a certain pattern, and each class has specific rows.

So perhaps the SeatSection class has a class type, start row, end row, and seat arrangement per row. The seat arrangement could be a list of seat letters for each row. For example, Business class rows 1-10 have seats A, C, D, F (if 1-2-1), but that's maybe too detailed. Alternatively, each row in Business has 4 seats: A, B, C, D. Wait, perhaps I should look up the actual seat map for A350-900.

Upon checking, the Airbus A350-900 can vary by airline, but a common configuration is:

- Business Class: Rows 1-8, 1-2-1 layout (each seat has direct aisle access). So each row has 4 seats: A, B, C, D. But the actual letters might vary. For example, some airlines use A, C, D, F for alternating rows to create a staggered layout. This is getting complicated. Maybe for the purpose of this program, each section can have a predefined number of seats per row, and seat letters generated accordingly.

Alternatively, perhaps each section is defined by the number of seats per row and the rows they occupy. For example:

- Business: rows 1-10, 4 seats per row (A, B, C, D)

- Premium Economy: rows 11-20, 8 seats per row (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H)

- Economy: rows 21-50, 9 seats per row (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I)

But this is a simplification. The actual A350-900 might have different numbers, but for the program, we can go with this.

So the SeatSection class would have the class type (enum), start row, end row, and seats per row. Then, when initializing, for each row in the section's range, create seats for each seat letter in the seats per row.

So for Business, rows 1-10, 4 seats per row (A, B, C, D). So row 1 has A, B, C, D; row 2 same, etc.

Now, how to model the seat letters. For a given number of seats per row, generate the letters. For example, 4 seats: A-D, 8: A-H, 9: A-I.

Wait, but in reality, the seat letters skip some letters to avoid confusion (like I is often skipped). Hmm, but maybe the problem doesn't require that level of detail. Let's proceed with consecutive letters.

So for a section with seatsPerRow = 4, the seat letters are A, B, C, D.

So when initializing, for each row in the section's range, create seats for each letter up to seatsPerRow.

So now, the Seat class would have row number, seat letter (String), status (enum: AVAILABLE, RESERVED, etc.), and seat class.

The SeatPlan class would manage all seats, perhaps as a list or a map for quick access.

Now, using Lombok to generate getters, constructors, etc. So Seat can be an @Value with all fields final.

The main application would have a SeatPlan initialized on startup.

Now, for logging, each class that needs to log would have a Logger instance via SLF4J.

So the structure would be:

- Enums: SeatClass (BUSINESS, PREMIUM_ECONOMY, ECONOMY), SeatStatus (AVAILABLE, RESERVED)

- Seat: immutable class with row, seatLetter, status, seatClass

- SeatSection: defines a section (seatClass, startRow, endRow, seatsPerRow)

- SeatPlan: contains a list of SeatSection, and generates all seats on initialization

The main class would initialize the SeatPlan, then handle the console menu. But the user interaction is via the console, but using SLF4J for output. Wait, but how to read input if all output is via logger? The input would still be via Scanner, but the prompts would be logged via SLF4J. For example, when the program needs to display a menu, it logs the menu options as info messages, and the user enters input via System.in.

But that might not be user-friendly, but according to the requirements, we have to avoid System.out.println. So perhaps the menu options are logged, and the user has to look at the logs to see the options. That seems odd, but perhaps that's the requirement.

Alternatively, maybe the user intended that all program output (like status messages) should use the logger, but the actual user prompts can use System.out. But the requirement says to avoid System.out.println, so maybe all output must go through the logger. So in that case, the menu would log messages like "Enter choice:" and the user would input via System.in, but the program's responses (like seat assignments) are logged.

This is a bit unconventional, but I'll proceed under that assumption.

Now, putting it all together. The main class would have a loop presenting a menu, reading user input, and performing actions like assigning seats, etc. But since the current requirement is only F01 (initialize seating plan), perhaps the initial code will just create the seating plan and log it.

Wait, the user said to write the program with the functions built in, starting with F01. So the code should include the structure for the other functions (reservations, changes, etc.) but the focus now is on initializing the seating plan.

But the answer needs to provide the full source code as per the initial requirements. So the code should include the seat initialization and the necessary structure for the other functions, even if they are not fully implemented yet.

So the code would have:

- SeatClass enum: BUSINESS, PREMIUM_ECONOMY, ECONOMY

- SeatStatus enum: AVAILABLE, RESERVED

- Seat class with Lombok @Value

- SeatSection record (or class) to define sections

- SeatPlan class that initializes all seats based on sections

- Main class with SLF4J logger, initializes SeatPlan, and perhaps a menu loop

Wait, but the user said to "only the source code should be specified" and "only changes should be specified (similar to Git)". Hmm, maybe they want the code presented as a diff, but the initial instruction says to write the program. The user might have meant that when changes are made (like in future iterations), they should be specified as diffs. But for now, the initial code is needed.

So putting it all together, here's a possible structure:

The main class FlightSeatManagerApp has a main method that initializes the seating plan. The SeatPlan is built with the correct sections for A350-900.

Using Lombok's @AllArgsConstructor and @NoArgsConstructor with static factory methods.

Wait, let's outline the classes:

1. Seat.java:

import lombok.Value;

@Value

public class Seat {

int row;

String seatLetter;

SeatStatus status;

SeatClass seatClass;

}

2. SeatStatus.java:

public enum SeatStatus {

AVAILABLE, RESERVED

}

3. SeatClass.java:

public enum SeatClass {

BUSINESS, PREMIUM_ECONOMY, ECONOMY

}

4. SeatSection.java:

import lombok.AllArgsConstructor;

import lombok.Getter;

@AllArgsConstructor

@Getter

public class SeatSection {

private SeatClass seatClass;

private int startRow;

private int endRow;

private int seatsPerRow;

}

5. SeatPlan.java:

import org.slf4j.Logger;

import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import java.util.ArrayList;

import java.util.List;

public class SeatPlan {

private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SeatPlan.class);

private final List<Seat> seats = new ArrayList<>();

public SeatPlan() {

initializeSeats();

}

private void initializeSeats() {

// Define seat sections for A350-900

List<SeatSection> sections = List.of(

new SeatSection(SeatClass.BUSINESS, 1, 8, 4),

new SeatSection(SeatClass.PREMIUM_ECONOMY, 9, 16, 8),

new SeatSection(SeatClass.ECONOMY, 17, 40, 9)

);

for (SeatSection section : sections) {

for (int row = section.getStartRow(); row <= section.getEndRow(); row++) {

for (int seatNum = 0; seatNum < section.getSeatsPerRow(); seatNum++) {

char seatLetter = (char) ('A' + seatNum);

seats.add(new Seat(

row,

String.valueOf(seatLetter),

SeatStatus.AVAILABLE,

section.getSeatClass()

));

}

}

}

log.info("Initialized seating plan with {} seats", seats.size());

}

public List<Seat> getSeats() {

return new ArrayList<>(seats);

}

}

Wait, but the rows for each section need to be accurate. For example, Business class on A350-900 might start at row 1 to 8, Premium Economy 9-16, and Economy 17-40. But actual configurations vary, but for the sake of the program, this is acceptable.

However, the seat letters for 4 seats would be A, B, C, D. For 8 seats, A to H. For 9 seats, A to I.

But in real configurations, sometimes middle seats are skipped (e.g., no 'I' in Economy to avoid confusion with '1'). But the problem doesn't specify this, so we'll proceed with consecutive letters.

The SeatPlan constructor initializes all seats based on the sections. Each seat starts as AVAILABLE.

The main application would create a SeatPlan instance, which logs the initialization.

Now, the main class:

import org.slf4j.Logger;

import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

public class FlightSeatManagerApp {

private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(FlightSeatManagerApp.class);

private final SeatPlan seatPlan;

public FlightSeatManagerApp() {

this.seatPlan = new SeatPlan();

}

public void start() {

log.info("Flight Seat Management System started");

// Here would be the menu loop, but per requirements, F01 is to initialize seating plan

// For now, just log the initialization

}

public static void main(String[] args) {

new FlightSeatManagerApp().start();

}

}

But this is very basic. The user probably expects a more detailed structure, including the ability to display availability, but since the requirement is F01, perhaps this is sufficient for the initial code.

Wait, but the problem statement says that the functions should be built-in, including display availability. But the user is asking for the code now, but according to the initial message, the answer should include all the code. However, the user's first request is to write the program with the given requirements, starting with F01. So perhaps the code should have the framework for the other functions but with F01 implemented.

Alternatively, the user might want the code to have all required functions, but the answer is focused on F01. However, the problem statement lists the functions as F01, but the answer needs to include all functions. Wait, no, the user says "The following functions should be built in: - F01: ...". So F01 is the first function, but other functions (assign seats, change assignments, etc.) are also required. However, the user hasn't provided their details yet. Wait, the original question says:

"The following functions should be built in:

- F01: Initialize seating plan - The complete seating plan of an Airbus A350-900 is generated when the system is started. Classes (e.g. Economy, Premium Economy, Business) and their seat rows and arrangement are taken into account"

So only F01 is listed, but the introduction mentions other functions (assign, change, display). But in the requirements, only F01 is specified. Wait, no. Looking back:

The original user message says:

"The following functions should be built in:

- F01: Initialize seating plan ..."

But after pasting the initial message, I see that the user listed F01 as the first function, but there are more functions implied (like making reservations, etc.), but in the actual message, the user might have only listed F01. Wait, no. Let me recheck the user's message.

Original problem statement:

"The following functions should be built in:

- F01: Initialize seating plan - ..."

Yes, only F01 is listed. So the other functions (assign, change, display) are part of the system's requirements but not detailed here. However, the current answer is to write the program with the built-in functions, starting with F01.

But perhaps the user expects the code to include the structure for the other functions, even if they're not implemented yet. Or maybe just F01 is required for this answer. The user's question is to write the program that does the following, and the first function is F01. The answer should focus on F01, but include the necessary structure for the other functions.

But given the information, perhaps the code should implement F01 and provide a basic menu structure where other functions can be added later.

So the main application would have a menu loop that allows the user to choose options, but for now, only the initialization is done.

But how to handle the menu if we can't use System.out.println? All output must be via SLF4J. So the menu options would be logged, and the user would input numbers corresponding to the options.

For example, the code could look like this in the start() method:

public void start() {

log.info("Flight Seat Management System started");

try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)) {

boolean running = true;

while (running) {

log.info("1. Display seat availability");

log.info("2. Assign seat");

log.info("3. Change assignment");

log.info("4. Exit");

log.info("Enter choice: ");

int choice = scanner.nextInt();

// handle choice

}

}

}

But the log.info statements would output the menu options to the log (e.g., console if configured), and the user enters the choice. However, in practice, the logger may not flush immediately, leading to the prompts not appearing in order. This could make the user experience problematic, but according to the requirements, we have to use SLF4J instead of System.out.

This is a bit tricky because SLF4J is typically for logging, not for interactive prompts. But the user explicitly said to avoid System.out.println and use SLF4J. So we have to comply.

Therefore, the menu options are logged, and the user inputs via Scanner.

Now, integrating this into the code:

The FlightSeatManagerApp's start method would have a loop that logs the menu, reads input, and dispatches to appropriate methods.

But for F01, the seat plan is initialized, and perhaps the 'display availability' function (if part of F01) is stubbed.

Wait, the problem says F01 is to initialize the seating plan. Other functions like display availability are separate. But since the user hasn't provided details on other functions, perhaps the code should include the initialization and a basic menu structure, with placeholders for other functions.

Putting it all together, here's the complete code:

SeatClass.java:

public enum SeatClass {

BUSINESS, PREMIUM_ECONOMY, ECONOMY

}

SeatStatus.java:

public enum SeatStatus {

AVAILABLE, RESERVED

}

Seat.java:

import lombok.Value;

@Value

SeatClass seatClass;

}

public class SeatSection {

private SeatClass seatClass;

private int startRow;

private int endRow;

private int seatsPerRow;

}

SeatPlan.java:

import org.slf4j.Logger;

import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import java.util.ArrayList;

import java.util.List;

public class SeatPlan {

private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SeatPlan.class);

private final List<Seat> seats = new ArrayList<>();

public SeatPlan() {

initializeSeats();

}

private void initializeSeats() {

List<SeatSection> sections = List.of(

new SeatSection(SeatClass.BUSINESS, 1, 8, 4),

new SeatSection(SeatClass.PREMIUM_ECONOMY, 9, 16, 8),

new SeatSection(SeatClass.ECONOMY, 17, 40, 9)

);

for (SeatSection section : sections) {

for (int row = section.getStartRow(); row <= section.getEndRow(); row++) {

for (int seatNum = 0; seatNum < section.getSeatsPerRow(); seatNum++) {

char seatLetter = (char) ('A' + seatNum);

seats.add(new Seat(row, String.valueOf(seatLetter), SeatStatus.AVAILABLE, section.getSeatClass()));

}

}

}

log.info("Initialized seating plan with {} seats", seats.size());

}

public List<Seat> getSeats() {

return new ArrayList<>(seats);

}

}

FlightSeatManagerApp.java:

import org.slf4j.Logger;

import org.slf4j.LoggerFactory;

import java.util.Scanner;

public class FlightSeatManagerApp {

private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(FlightSeatManagerApp.class);

private final SeatPlan seatPlan;

public FlightSeatManagerApp() {

this.seatPlan = new SeatPlan();

}

public void start() {

log.info("Flight Seat Management System started");

try (Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in)) {

boolean running = true;

while (running) {

log.info("\nMenu:");

log.info("1. Display seat availability");

log.info("2. Assign seat");

log.info("3. Change seat assignment");

log.info("4. Make reservation");

log.info("5. Exit");

log.info("Enter your choice: ");

int choice = scanner.nextInt();

scanner.nextLine(); // consume newline

switch (choice) {

case 1:

displaySeatAvailability();

break;

case 2:

assignSeat(scanner);

break;

case 3:

changeAssignment(scanner);

break;

case 4:

makeReservation(scanner);

break;

case 5:

running = false;

break;

default:

log.warn("Invalid choice. Please try again.");

}

}

}

log.info("System exiting...");

}

private void displaySeatAvailability() {

log.info("Seat Availability:");

seatPlan.getSeats().forEach(seat ->

log.info("Row: {}, Seat: {}, Class: {}, Status: {}",

seat.getRow(), seat.getSeatLetter(), seat.getSeatClass(), seat.getStatus()));

}

private void assignSeat(Scanner scanner) {

// Placeholder for seat assignment logic

log.info("Enter row and seat letter to assign: ");

int row = scanner.nextInt();

String seatLetter = scanner.next();

log.info("Assigning seat {}{}", row, seatLetter);

}

private void changeAssignment(Scanner scanner) {

// Placeholder for changing assignment

log.info("Enter current seat and new seat: ");

// Implementation omitted

}

private void makeReservation(Scanner scanner) {

// Placeholder for making reservation

log.info("Enter passenger details and seat: ");

// Implementation omitted

}

public static void main(String[] args) {

new FlightSeatManagerApp().start();

}

}

Now, this code includes the initialization of the seating plan (F01) and stubs for other functions. It uses Lombok's @Value for Seat to reduce boilerplate. The logging is done via SLF4J, and all output is through the logger.

However, there's a problem: when using SLF4J, the log messages might not appear immediately unless the logging framework is configured to output to the console. The user would need an SLF4J binding like Logback or SimpleLogger. For the sake of the code, we assume that the necessary configuration is in place (like adding SimpleLogger to the classpath).

Also, the SeatPlan's seats are stored in a list. For actual seat management, a more efficient structure (like a map by row and seat letter) would be better, but for simplicity, a list is used here.

The code meets the requirements: it's a console app, uses Lombok, SLF4J, and initializes the seating plan for A350-900 with the specified classes and seat arrangements.


# Answer
To address the problem, we'll create a Java console application that manages seat assignments for an Airbus A350-900 using Lombok and SLF4J. The solution initializes the seating plan according to the aircraft's class structure and provides a menu-driven interface for further operations.

Approach
Data Modeling:

Define enums for SeatClass (Business, Premium Economy, Economy) and SeatStatus (Available, Reserved).

Use Lombok's @Value to create an immutable Seat class representing each seat with row, seat letter, status, and class.

Seat Plan Initialization:

Create SeatSection to define each cabin class's row range and seats per row.

Initialize seats for each section in SeatPlan based on Airbus A350-900's typical configuration.

Console Interface:

Implement a menu loop using SLF4J for logging outputs and Scanner for user input.

Placeholder methods for seat assignment, reservation, and modification to be expanded later.

... CODE ...

Explanation
Data Modeling: Enums and Lombok annotations simplify the model classes, reducing boilerplate.

Seat Initialization: SeatPlan constructs seats based on predefined sections, each specifying class, rows, and seat layout.

Console Interface: The main app uses a loop to present a menu, handling user input and dispatching actions. All outputs use SLF4J logging.

Extensibility: Placeholder methods allow future implementation of seat assignment, reservation changes, and more, maintaining a clear structure for expansion.
