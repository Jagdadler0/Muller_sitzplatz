# Reasoning

Okay, let's tackle F04: Reserve seat. The user wants provisional reservations with time limits or required confirmation. So, how do I approach this?

First, I need to differentiate between a booking (permanent) and a reservation (temporary). From F03, bookings are permanent assignments. Reservations should expire after a certain time or need confirmation.

Hmm, so maybe I need a new status for reserved seats. Wait, the existing SeatStatus has RESERVED. But how to track the expiration time? Maybe create a Reservation class that includes a timestamp. Then, the Seat can hold either a Booking or a Reservation.

Wait, in the previous code, the Seat class has a Booking field. But now, reservations are temporary, so maybe the Seat should have a reservation field instead when it's reserved. Or perhaps generalize it to have a ReservationDetails that includes both booking and reservation info with a type.

Alternatively, maybe add an expiration time to the Seat itself. But that might complicate things. Maybe create a separate Reservation record that includes the expiration time and passenger info, separate from Booking.

Wait, in F03, Booking is a record with name, booking number, etc. For reservations, we need similar info but with an expiration. So perhaps create a Reservation record with passenger name, reservation ID, expiration time, and special requests. Then, the Seat can have either a Booking or a Reservation, but how to model that?

Hmm, perhaps the Seat class can have a composite field that can hold either a Booking or a Reservation. But in Java, that's a bit tricky. Maybe create a superclass or interface for both, but that might complicate things. Alternatively, have separate fields: Booking booking and Reservation reservation. When a seat is reserved, the reservation field is populated, and the status is RESERVED. When confirmed, the reservation is converted to a booking, and the status changes to OCCUPIED or something else.

But the SeatStatus already has RESERVED. So maybe when a seat is reserved, it's in RESERVED status with a Reservation object. When confirmed, it becomes OCCUPIED with a Booking. But the user might need to track both states. Alternatively, keep the status as RESERVED for provisional and OCCUPIED for confirmed. But the problem says reservations can expire or need confirmation. So the system needs to track expiration times.

So, steps:

1. Create a Reservation record that includes passenger details and expiration time.

2. Update the Seat class to include a Reservation field alongside Booking.

3. Modify the SeatPlan's bookSeat method to handle reservations, setting the expiration time.

4. Add a method to check for expired reservations and release seats.

5. Update the display to show reserved seats with their status.

6. Implement a confirmation process that converts a reservation to a booking.

Wait, but the existing bookSeat method in F03 assigns a Booking and sets status to RESERVED. But according to F04, reservations are provisional. Maybe the Booking in F03 is actually a confirmed reservation, and F04 introduces provisional reservations. This might mean that the previous approach conflated the two. Need to clarify.

The user's F03 says "Book seat - A free seat can be permanently assigned to a passenger." So Booking is permanent. F04 is about provisional reservations. So, we need to separate the two: Booking is permanent (status OCCUPIED?), and Reservation is temporary (status RESERVED) with an expiration.

Wait, but in the previous code, when booking a seat, the status is set to RESERVED. That might be incorrect. Maybe the status should be OCCUPIED for bookings, and RESERVED for temporary reservations. But that would require changing the previous code. But according to the user's F03, booking is permanent, so perhaps the status should be OCCUPIED. Then F04's reservation uses RESERVED status with an expiration.

But in the previous step (F03), the solution used RESERVED status for bookings. That might have been a mistake. Let me check: In the user's F03, when booking, the seat is permanently assigned. So the status should be OCCUPIED, not RESERVED. But in the code provided, after booking, the seat's status is set to RESERVED. That's a conflict. So that needs correction.

So, first, adjust F03's code: When a seat is booked (permanently assigned), its status should be OCCUPIED. Reservations (F04) would use RESERVED status with an expiration time. That way, the two are distinct.

But this requires modifying the previous code. However, in the current problem, the user is asking for F04, so we need to adjust the existing code to accommodate both booking and reservation.

So, steps to implement F04:

1. Correct F03's SeatStatus usage: Booking sets status to OCCUPIED, Reservation uses RESERVED.

2. Create a Reservation record with expiration time.

3. Update Seat class to include a Reservation field.

4. Add methods to reserve a seat with a time limit.

5. Implement a background thread or periodic check to release expired reservations.

6. Allow confirmation of reservations, converting them to bookings.

But given that this is a console app, a background thread might be complex. Instead, check for expired reservations each time the system starts or during certain operations.

Alternatively, during seat display, check expiration and update statuses. But that might not be real-time.

Alternatively, when trying to reserve a seat, check if existing reservations are expired and release them.

But let's proceed step by step.

First, correct the SeatStatus in F03: When a seat is booked (permanent), status is OCCUPIED. Reservations are RESERVED with expiration.

Modify the SeatPlan's bookSeat method to set status to OCCUPIED when booking. Then, create a new method reserveSeat that sets status to RESERVED and stores the reservation with expiration.

But the user's F04 says reservations can be made during online booking or check-in, with time limits or needing confirmation. So the system needs to handle both types: time-based expiration or manual confirmation.

So, for the reservation, we need to track the expiration time. Let's create a Reservation record that includes passenger info, reservation ID, expiration timestamp, and special requests.

Then, in the Seat class, include a Reservation field. When a seat is reserved, the Reservation is stored, and status is RESERVED. When confirmed, the Reservation is converted to a Booking, status becomes OCCUPIED.

So, changes:

1. Create Reservation record.

2. Update Seat to have Reservation instead of Booking when reserved.

3. Add methods to reserve a seat (with expiration) and confirm reservation.

4. Handle expiration by checking the current time against reservation's expiration.

Now, adjust the existing code.

In F03, the Booking is stored in the Seat, but that should be for OCCUPIED status. Wait, no. Maybe:

- A booked seat (permanent) has status OCCUPIED and a Booking.

- A reserved seat (temporary) has status RESERVED and a Reservation.

So, the Seat class should have two optional fields: Booking and Reservation. But in Java, we can't have multiple optional fields easily. Alternatively, have a single field for reservation details, which can be either a Booking or a Reservation, but that requires a common interface.

Alternatively, since using Lombok, maybe create a combined class, but that complicates things. Alternatively, split into two fields: Booking and Reservation, where only one is non-null depending on the status.

So, modifying the Seat class:

@Value

public class Seat {

int row;

String seatLetter;

SeatStatus status;

SeatClass seatClass;

Booking booking; // Non-null if status is OCCUPIED

Reservation reservation; // Non-null if status is RESERVED

}

But this requires that when status is RESERVED, reservation is not null, and booking is null. Similarly for OCCUPIED.

This adds complexity but allows differentiation.

Alternatively, have a single Object field, but that's not type-safe.

Alternatively, create a superclass for Booking and Reservation. For example, SeatAssignment, but in Java, records can't extend classes. So maybe an interface.

But maybe it's better to have separate fields. So:

In Seat.java:

@Value

public class Seat {

int row;

String seatLetter;

SeatStatus status;

SeatClass seatClass;

Booking booking; // For OCCUPIED status

Reservation reservation; // For RESERVED status

}

Then, when creating a Seat, if it's available, both booking and reservation are null. If reserved, reservation is non-null and status is RESERVED. If booked (occupied), booking is non-null and status is OCCUPIED.

But this requires ensuring consistency between status and the presence of booking/reservation.

Now, in F03, when assigning a seat (permanent booking), the status is OCCUPIED and booking is set. In F04, when reserving, status is RESERVED and reservation is set.

So, modifying the bookSeat method in SeatPlan for F03:

public boolean bookSeat(int row, String seatLetter, Booking booking) {

for (int i = 0; i < seats.size(); i++) {

Seat currentSeat = seats.get(i);

if (currentSeat.getRow() == row && currentSeat.getSeatLetter().equalsIgnoreCase(seatLetter)) {

if (currentSeat.getStatus() == SeatStatus.AVAILABLE) {

Seat newSeat = new Seat(

currentSeat.getRow(),

currentSeat.getSeatLetter(),

SeatStatus.OCCUPIED, // Changed from RESERVED to OCCUPIED

currentSeat.getSeatClass(),

booking, // Set booking

null // Reservation is null

);

seats.set(i, newSeat);

return true;

} else {

return false;

}

}

}

return false;

}

Then, create a new method in SeatPlan for reserving a seat:

public boolean reserveSeat(int row, String seatLetter, Reservation reservation) {

for (int i = 0; i < seats.size(); i++) {

Seat currentSeat = seats.get(i);

if (currentSeat.getRow() == row && currentSeat.getSeatLetter().equalsIgnoreCase(seatLetter)) {

if (currentSeat.getStatus() == SeatStatus.AVAILABLE) {

Seat newSeat = new Seat(

currentSeat.getRow(),

currentSeat.getSeatLetter(),

SeatStatus.RESERVED,

currentSeat.getSeatClass(),

null, // Booking is null

reservation // Set reservation

);

seats.set(i, newSeat);

return true;

} else {

return false;

}

}

}

return false;

}

But this requires modifying the Seat class constructor, which previously had only Booking. Now, adding Reservation as another field.

Wait, in the previous step (F03), the Seat class had a Booking field. Now, adding a Reservation field. So the @Value class Seat will have both fields. But when a seat is available, both are null. When reserved, reservation is non-null. When booked, booking is non-null.

This requires changing the Seat class as follows:

@Value

public class Seat {

int row;

String seatLetter;

SeatStatus status;

SeatClass seatClass;

Booking booking; // Present if status is OCCUPIED

Reservation reservation; // Present if status is RESERVED

}

And in the SeatPlan's initializeSeats method, when creating seats, both booking and reservation are null.

Now, for F04, implement the reserveSeat method in SeatPlan, and add a new menu option for reserving seats.

But wait, the user's F04 says that reservations can be made during online booking or check-in. So the existing menu in FlightSeatManagerApp has an option 4: Make reservation. In the previous code, the makeReservation method was a placeholder. Now, need to implement it.

So, modify the makeReservation method to collect passenger info and reservation duration, then call seatPlan.reserveSeat.

Also, need to handle expiration. So, the Reservation record should have an expiration timestamp.

So, creating Reservation.java:

import java.time.Instant;

public record Reservation(String passengerName, String reservationId, Instant expirationTime, String specialRequests) {}

Then, in FlightSeatManagerApp's makeReservation method, after collecting passenger details, ask for reservation duration (e.g., in minutes), calculate expirationTime as Instant.now().plusSeconds(duration * 60), create a Reservation object, and call reserveSeat.

But first, need to adjust the SeatPlan to have the reserveSeat method.

Also, need a way to check for expired reservations and release them. This can be done by adding a method in SeatPlan that iterates through all seats and releases those where expirationTime is before Instant.now().

So, in SeatPlan:

public void releaseExpiredReservations() {

Instant now = Instant.now();

for (int i = 0; i < seats.size(); i++) {

Seat seat = seats.get(i);

if (seat.getStatus() == SeatStatus.RESERVED && seat.getReservation() != null) {

if (seat.getReservation().expirationTime().isBefore(now)) {

Seat newSeat = new Seat(

seat.getRow(),

seat.getSeatLetter(),

SeatStatus.AVAILABLE,

seat.getSeatClass(),

null,

null

);

seats.set(i, newSeat);

}

}

}

}

But when to call this method? Ideally, before any seat display or reservation attempt. So, in the FlightSeatManagerApp's start method, each time the menu is displayed, call seatPlan.releaseExpiredReservations().

Alternatively, call it at the beginning of displaySeatAvailability, assignSeat, reserveSeat, etc.

But for simplicity, maybe call it each time the menu loops.

So, in the main loop of FlightSeatManagerApp's start method:

while (running) {

seatPlan.releaseExpiredReservations(); // Check and release expired

// display menu and handle input

}

This ensures that expired reservations are released before any operation.

Now, implementing the makeReservation method:

private void makeReservation(Scanner scanner) {

log.info("Enter passenger name:");

String name = scanner.nextLine();

log.info("Enter reservation ID:");

String reservationId = scanner.nextLine();

log.info("Enter reservation duration in minutes:");

int durationMinutes = scanner.nextInt();

scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline

log.info("Enter special requests (if any):");

String specialRequests = scanner.nextLine();

Instant expirationTime = Instant.now().plusSeconds(durationMinutes * 60L);

log.info("Enter row number:");

int row = scanner.nextInt();

log.info("Enter seat letter:");

String seatLetter = scanner.next().toUpperCase();

scanner.nextLine(); // Consume remaining newline

// Validate seat

Seat seat = seatPlan.getSeats().stream()

.filter(s -> s.getRow() == row && s.getSeatLetter().equals(seatLetter))

.findFirst()

.orElse(null);

if (seat == null) {

log.error("Seat {}{} does not exist.", row, seatLetter);

return;

}

if (seat.getStatus() != SeatStatus.AVAILABLE) {

log.error("Seat {}{} is not available.", row, seatLetter);

return;

}

Reservation reservation = new Reservation(name, reservationId, expirationTime, specialRequests);

boolean success = seatPlan.reserveSeat(row, seatLetter, reservation);

if (success) {

log.info("Reserved seat {}{} for {} until {}", row, seatLetter, name, expirationTime);

} else {

log.error("Failed to reserve seat {}{}.", row, seatLetter);

}

}

Also, need to update the display method to show reservation status and expiration. The getStatusSymbol method in FlightSeatManagerApp already uses [R] for RESERVED, which is correct.

Additionally, when displaying seat details, perhaps show the expiration time, but that might complicate the display. Since the main display uses symbols, maybe just [R] is sufficient, and detailed info can be logged elsewhere.

Now, the reservation is stored with an expiration time, and expired reservations are automatically released when the menu is displayed again.

Another consideration: confirming a reservation. The user might need a way to confirm a reservation, converting it to a booking. This would involve changing the seat's status from RESERVED to OCCUPIED, moving the reservation details to a booking.

But according to F03, booking is a permanent assignment. So confirming a reservation would require creating a Booking from the Reservation. However, the Booking record in F03 has a booking number, which the reservation might not have. So the user would need to provide a booking number during confirmation.

Alternatively, the reservation could have a booking number generated upon confirmation.

But for simplicity, perhaps when confirming a reservation, the user is prompted to enter a booking number, then the seat is updated from RESERVED to OCCUPIED, with the Booking details.

This requires adding a new menu option for confirming reservations, or integrating it into the existing options.

But the current menu has:

1. Display seat availability

2. Assign seat (permanent booking)

3. Change seat assignment

4. Make reservation

5. Exit

So, perhaps add a new option for confirming reservations. But the user's initial spec didn't mention it. Alternatively, handle it under option 3 (change assignment), but that's not intuitive.

Alternatively, during the reservation process, but that's not part of F04's requirements. The user's F04 requires that reservations can be confirmed, so there must be a way to do that.

Thus, adding a new menu option:

6. Confirm reservation

But modifying the menu would require changing the existing code. Alternatively, extend option 3 (change assignment) to handle confirmation, but that might be off-spec.

Given the problem statement for F04: reservations must be actively confirmed. So there should be a way to confirm them.

Thus, updating the menu to include a new option:

6. Confirm reservation

7. Exit

But the initial code had option 5 as Exit. So need to adjust the menu options.

This requires modifying the FlightSeatManagerApp's start method:

log.info("1. Display seat availability");

log.info("2. Assign seat");

log.info("3. Change seat assignment");

log.info("4. Make reservation");

log.info("5. Confirm reservation");

log.info("6. Exit");

Then, handle case 5 for confirming reservations.

But this is getting a bit beyond the current problem's scope. The user's F04 says reservations can be made and need confirmation or have a time limit. So the confirmation process is part of F04.

Thus, the code needs to handle confirmation.

So, implement a confirmReservation method that:

- Asks for seat row and letter

- Checks if the seat is reserved (status RESERVED)

- Prompts for booking number

- Converts the reservation to a booking (status OCCUPIED), storing the booking details.

This requires adding a confirmReservation method in SeatPlan:

public boolean confirmReservation(int row, String seatLetter, String bookingNumber) {

for (int i = 0; i < seats.size(); i++) {

Seat seat = seats.get(i);

if (seat.getRow() == row && seat.getSeatLetter().equalsIgnoreCase(seatLetter)) {

if (seat.getStatus() == SeatStatus.RESERVED && seat.getReservation() != null) {

Reservation reservation = seat.getReservation();

Booking booking = new Booking(

reservation.passengerName(),

bookingNumber,

reservation.specialRequests()

);

Seat newSeat = new Seat(

seat.getRow(),

seat.getSeatLetter(),

SeatStatus.OCCUPIED,

seat.getSeatClass(),

booking,

null

);

seats.set(i, newSeat);

return true;

} else {

return false;

}

}

}

return false;

}

Then, in FlightSeatManagerApp:

private void confirmReservation(Scanner scanner) {

log.info("Enter row number:");

int row = scanner.nextInt();

log.info("Enter seat letter:");

String seatLetter = scanner.next().toUpperCase();

scanner.nextLine(); // Consume newline

Seat seat = seatPlan.getSeats().stream()

.filter(s -> s.getRow() == row && s.getSeatLetter().equals(seatLetter))

.findFirst()

.orElse(null);

if (seat == null) {

log.error("Seat {}{} does not exist.", row, seatLetter);

return;

}

if (seat.getStatus() != SeatStatus.RESERVED || seat.getReservation() == null) {

log.error("Seat {}{} is not reserved.", row, seatLetter);

return;

}

log.info("Enter booking number:");

String bookingNumber = scanner.nextLine();

boolean success = seatPlan.confirmReservation(row, seatLetter, bookingNumber);

if (success) {

log.info("Reservation for seat {}{} confirmed with booking number {}.", row, seatLetter, bookingNumber);

} else {

log.error("Failed to confirm reservation for seat {}{}.", row, seatLetter);

}

}

Then, add the new menu option (option 5) to call confirmReservation.

But in the initial code, the menu had 5. Exit. So changing:

Original menu options:

1. Display seat availability

2. Assign seat

3. Change seat assignment

4. Make reservation

5. Exit

Now, to add confirm reservation, need to insert a new option 5 and shift exit to 6.

Thus, in the start method:

log.info("1. Display seat availability");

log.info("2. Assign seat");

log.info("3. Change seat assignment");

log.info("4. Make reservation");

log.info("5. Confirm reservation");

log.info("6. Exit");

And in the switch statement:

case 5 -> confirmReservation(scanner);

case 6 -> running = false;

But this requires adjusting the code from previous steps, which might have conflicts. However, since the user is incrementally adding features, each step must adjust the previous code.

But given that the user is asking for F04 now, and the previous steps included up to F03, the current code must integrate F04 without breaking previous functionality.

In conclusion, the necessary changes to implement F04 are:

- Update Seat class to include Reservation field.

- Create Reservation record with expiration time.

- Add reserveSeat method in SeatPlan.

- Implement makeReservation in FlightSeatManagerApp, collecting reservation details and expiration.

- Add method to release expired reservations.

- Add confirmReservation method to convert reservations to bookings.

- Update menu options and handling.

Also, correct the status usage in F03: permanent bookings are OCCUPIED, reservations are RESERVED.

Finally, ensure that when displaying seats, RESERVED status is shown with [R], and OCCUPIED with [O].
