# Reasoning

Okay, I need to implement the export functionality for occupancy data and passenger lists. Let me start by looking at the existing code and see what needs to be added.

First, the user wants to export occupancy statistics and passenger lists as text files. So, I'll need two separate export methods: one for the stats and another for the passenger list.

For the occupancy data, there's already a method in SeatPlan that calculates the stats. I can reuse that to generate the content for the file. The stats are in a ClassStats record, so I need to format that into a readable string. Maybe create a helper method to convert the stats map into a string with lines and boxes, similar to how it's displayed in the console.

For the passenger list, there's a method that retrieves occupied seats. I can loop through those seats, get the booking details, and format each entry into lines in the file. Each entry should have the seat info, passenger name, ticket number, and special requests.

Next, I need to handle file writing. Java's Files.write() can be used, but I should make sure to handle exceptions properly. Since the app uses SLF4J for logging, any exceptions should be logged instead of using printStackTrace.

I should add new menu options for exporting each type of data. The user might want to export one or both, so two separate menu items: one for occupancy data and another for passenger list. Wait, the requirement says "occupancy plans and passenger lists can be exported", so maybe two options? Or one that does both? The user probably wants separate exports, so two options would be better.

When the user selects the export option, the app should prompt for a filename. Using a Scanner to read the filename input. Then, write the data to that file. If the file exists, it will be overwritten, which is acceptable unless specified otherwise. The problem doesn't mention handling existing files, so I'll proceed with overwriting.

Testing the file paths is important. The user should enter a filename, and the code will write to the current working directory unless a path is specified. I should log the success or failure, including the file path where it was saved.

Let me sketch out the steps:

1. Add export methods in FlightSeatManagerApp for stats and passenger list.

2. Create helper methods to generate the content strings from existing data.

3. Update the menu to include export options.

4. Handle file I/O with proper error logging.

Potential issues: File permissions, invalid filenames. Need to catch exceptions and inform the user via logs.

For the content generation:

- The occupancy stats can use the same formatted string as the display method but without the log.info calls. Instead, build a string with line breaks.

- The passenger list can iterate through each occupied seat and append the details to a string buffer.

Implementing helper methods like generateOccupancyReport() and generatePassengerListReport() that return the formatted strings. Then, write those strings to files.

Testing: After writing the file, log the path so the user knows where to find it.

Now, code changes:

In FlightSeatManagerApp, add two new methods: exportOccupancyData and exportPassengerList. Each will prompt for a filename, generate the report content, and write to the file.

Add menu options 11 and 12 for these exports, and adjust the exit option to 14.

Make sure to handle IOException and log errors using the SLF4J logger.

Example code outline:

private void exportOccupancyData(Scanner scanner) {

prompt for filename

generate report string

write to file

log success or error

}

private void exportPassengerList(Scanner scanner) {

similar steps

}

Update menu options and switch cases.

Also, create the helper methods to build the report strings without using System.out.println.

For example, generateOccupancyReport() would loop through the stats and build a string with the same formatted lines as shown in the display, but using \n for line breaks.

Testing edge cases: empty passenger list, all seats available, special characters in filenames. But since it's a console app, relying on user input, maybe just handle exceptions generally.

Finally, ensure that all file operations are properly closed, but since using Files.write, which handles closing automatically.
