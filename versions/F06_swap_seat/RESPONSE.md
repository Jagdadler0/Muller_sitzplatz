Okay, let's tackle implementing the seat swap functionality. The user wants two seats to be swapped, updating both reservations. Hmm, first, I need to figure out how to handle this in the existing codebase.

So, the main points here are: swapping two seats, which could be either reserved or occupied. Both seats need to have their details exchanged. Let me check the current SeatPlan and Seat classes.

Each Seat has a status, booking, and reservation. When swapping, I need to ensure both seats are in a state that allows swappingâ€”probably either reserved or occupied. Also, their classes should be the same? Or can they swap across classes? The problem statement says "at the customer's request," so maybe they can swap within the same class. But the requirement doesn't specify, so maybe just allow any two seats as long as they are reserved or occupied.

Wait, but in reality, passengers might want to swap within the same class. Maybe the system should enforce that both seats are in the same class. But the original problem statement doesn't mention this, so perhaps leave it as a business rule. For now, maybe just swap regardless of class unless specified otherwise. Let's proceed without class restriction unless told otherwise.

So, steps needed:

1. Add a method in SeatPlan to swap two seats. Check if both seats are either reserved or occupied. Then, swap their booking and reservation details.

Wait, but each seat can be either reserved (has a reservation) or occupied (has a booking). So swapping a reserved seat with an occupied one would require transferring the reservation to booking and vice versa. That might complicate things. Maybe the swap should only be allowed if both seats are in the same state? Or handle both cases.

Alternatively, maybe the swap should transfer whatever data each seat has. For example, if seat A is reserved (has a reservation) and seat B is occupied (has a booking), swapping them would result in seat A having the booking from B and seat B having the reservation from A, but their statuses would also need to change accordingly. That might be more complex.

But according to the problem statement: "Both reservations are updated." So maybe the function is intended for swapping reserved seats. Or perhaps the term "reservations" here refers to both bookings and reservations. Hmm, the wording is a bit ambiguous.

Alternatively, the user might mean that if both seats are reserved, swap their reservation details. If one is booked (occupied), swap their booking details. If one is reserved and the other is booked, maybe it's not allowed. The requirement says "Two seats can be swapped", but it's not clear if any status is allowed.

To proceed, perhaps we should allow swapping only if both seats are either reserved or occupied. Let's check the statuses. If both are reserved, swap their reservations. If both are occupied, swap their bookings. If one is reserved and the other occupied, maybe it's not allowed.

So, the method in SeatPlan would:

- Check if both seats exist.

- Check if both are either reserved or occupied.

- For each seat, create a new Seat object with the other's booking/reservation and update their statuses accordingly.

Wait, but when swapping, the statuses would remain the same. For example, if seat1 is reserved and seat2 is reserved, swap their reservations. If seat1 is occupied and seat2 is occupied, swap their bookings. If one is reserved and the other is occupied, perhaps it's invalid.

Alternatively, maybe the swap is allowed regardless of status, as long as they are not available or blocked. But need to handle the data appropriately.

Let me think of an example:

Seat A: Reserved (has Reservation X)

Seat B: Reserved (has Reservation Y)

After swap: Seat A has Reservation Y, Seat B has Reservation X.

Another example:

Seat A: Occupied (Booking X)

Seat B: Occupied (Booking Y)

After swap: Seat A has Booking Y, Seat B has Booking X.

Another case:

Seat A: Reserved (Reservation X)

Seat B: Occupied (Booking Y)

After swap: Seat A becomes Occupied with Booking Y, Seat B becomes Reserved with Reservation X. But this would require changing their statuses. Is this allowed?

The problem statement says "swap seat - Two seats can be swapped". It doesn't specify that their statuses must remain the same. So perhaps the swap would exchange their entire data, including status. But that might lead to inconsistent states. For example, swapping a reserved seat with an occupied one would result in one being occupied without a booking, which is invalid.

Wait, no. The seat's status is determined by whether it has a booking or reservation. So when swapping, if we move a reservation from one seat to another, the target seat's status should become reserved, and vice versa.

Hmm, this is getting complicated. Maybe the best approach is to only allow swapping seats that are both in the same state: both reserved or both occupied. That way, their statuses remain the same, and only the booking or reservation data is exchanged.

So, the method should:

1. Find both seats by row and seat letter.

2. Check if both are either reserved or occupied.

3. If both are reserved, swap their reservations.

4. If both are occupied, swap their bookings.

5. If not, return an error.

But how to implement this in code?

Looking at the Seat class, each Seat has status, booking, reservation. So for two seats, seat1 and seat2:

If seat1 is reserved (status RESERVED) and seat2 is reserved:

- Swap their reservations.

- The statuses remain RESERVED.

If seat1 is occupied (status OCCUPIED) and seat2 is occupied:

- Swap their bookings.

- Statuses remain OCCUPIED.

If one is reserved and the other occupied, swap not allowed.

So, the code in SeatPlan's swap method would:

- Find both seats.

- Check if they are both RESERVED or both OCCUPIED.

- For RESERVED: swap reservations, keep status as RESERVED.

- For OCCUPIED: swap bookings, keep status as OCCUPIED.

Now, how to implement this.

In the SeatPlan class, we have a list of seats. We can loop through to find the seats by row and seat letter. Once found, check their statuses.

Wait, but the current code for SeatPlan has methods like bookSeat, reserveSeat, etc. Each time modifying the seat in the list by creating a new Seat object and replacing the old one.

So, for swapping, we need to:

1. Find the indices of both seats in the list.

2. Check their statuses.

3. If allowed, create new Seat objects with swapped reservations/bookings.

4. Replace the old seats in the list.

So, code steps:

public boolean swapSeats(int row1, String seatLetter1, int row2, String seatLetter2) {

// Find both seats

int index1 = -1, index2 = -1;

Seat seat1 = null, seat2 = null;

for (int i = 0; i < seats.size(); i++) {

Seat s = seats.get(i);

if (s.getRow() == row1 && s.getSeatLetter().equalsIgnoreCase(seatLetter1)) {

index1 = i;

seat1 = s;

}

if (s.getRow() == row2 && s.getSeatLetter().equalsIgnoreCase(seatLetter2)) {

index2 = i;

seat2 = s;

}

}

if (index1 == -1 || index2 == -1) {

return false; // One or both seats not found

}

// Check status compatibility

if (seat1.getStatus() != seat2.getStatus()) {

return false;

}

if (seat1.getStatus() == SeatStatus.RESERVED) {

// Swap reservations

Reservation res1 = seat1.getReservation();

Reservation res2 = seat2.getReservation();

Seat newSeat1 = new Seat(seat1.getRow(), seat1.getSeatLetter(), SeatStatus.RESERVED, seat1.getSeatClass(), null, res2);

Seat newSeat2 = new Seat(seat2.getRow(), seat2.getSeatLetter(), SeatStatus.RESERVED, seat2.getSeatClass(), null, res1);

seats.set(index1, newSeat1);

seats.set(index2, newSeat2);

return true;

} else if (seat1.getStatus() == SeatStatus.OCCUPIED) {

// Swap bookings

Booking book1 = seat1.getBooking();

Booking book2 = seat2.getBooking();

Seat newSeat1 = new Seat(seat1.getRow(), seat1.getSeatLetter(), SeatStatus.OCCUPIED, seat1.getSeatClass(), book2, null);

Seat newSeat2 = new Seat(seat2.getRow(), seat2.getSeatLetter(), SeatStatus.OCCUPIED, seat2.getSeatClass(), book1, null);

seats.set(index1, newSeat1);

seats.set(index2, newSeat2);

return true;

} else {

// One or both seats are available or blocked; cannot swap

return false;

}

}

Then, in FlightSeatManagerApp, add a new menu option for swapping seats. The method would prompt for both seat details and call swapSeats.

In the menu:

case 7 -> swapSeats(scanner);

case 8 -> running = false;

Wait, previous step had menu options up to 7 (Exit). So need to adjust the menu numbering.

Wait, in F05, the last step added:

case 6 -> cancelSeat(scanner);

case 7 -> running = false;

Now, adding F06 (swap), the menu options need to be:

1. Display seat availability

2. Assign seat

3. Change seat assignment

4. Make reservation

5. Confirm reservation

6. Cancel seat

7. Swap seats

8. Exit

So in the start() method's menu, add option 7 for swap.

Then, in the switch:

case 7 -> swapSeats(scanner);

case 8 -> running = false;

Then, implement swapSeats method in FlightSeatManagerApp:

private void swapSeats(Scanner scanner) {

log.info("Enter first seat row:");

int row1 = scanner.nextInt();

log.info("Enter first seat letter:");

String seatLetter1 = scanner.next().toUpperCase();

log.info("Enter second seat row:");

int row2 = scanner.nextInt();

log.info("Enter second seat letter:");

String seatLetter2 = scanner.next().toUpperCase();

scanner.nextLine(); // consume newline

boolean success = seatPlan.swapSeats(row1, seatLetter1, row2, seatLetter2);

if (success) {

log.info("Seats {}{} and {}{} swapped successfully.", row1, seatLetter1, row2, seatLetter2);

} else {

log.error("Swap failed. Check seat availability and statuses.");

}

}

But need to make sure that the SeatPlan's swapSeats method is correctly implemented. Also, when swapping, the seat class might be different. But according to the problem statement, it's allowed? The user might want to swap seats between classes. But in reality, that's unlikely. However, the problem statement doesn't restrict it. So the code allows it as long as both are reserved or occupied.

Wait, but in the SeatPlan's swap method, when creating new seats, the seatClass is taken from the original seat. So when swapping seat1 (Business) with seat2 (Economy), after swapping, seat1 will have the reservation from seat2 but remain in Business class. Similarly for seat2. That might not be intended. So, perhaps we should only allow swapping within the same class. Because otherwise, swapping a Business class seat with an Economy seat would result in the passenger being moved to a different class without changing the class designation of the seat.

Wait, the seat's class is part of the Seat object. So if you swap the reservations/bookings between seats of different classes, the passengers would effectively be moved to a different class. For example, if seat1 is Business class and seat2 is Economy, swapping their bookings would mean the passenger from seat1 is now in seat2 (Economy), and vice versa. That's a valid scenario if the passengers agree to change classes. So the code allows it.

But perhaps the system should enforce that swaps are within the same class. The problem statement doesn't specify, so the code as written allows cross-class swaps.

But in the code above, the new seats retain their original seatClass. So when you swap, the class of the seat doesn't change, only the booking/reservation. So passengers would be moving to different classes. For example:

Seat1: Business, Occupied with Booking A

Seat2: Economy, Occupied with Booking B

After swap:

Seat1: Business, Occupied with Booking B

Seat2: Economy, Occupied with Booking A

So the passengers are now in different classes, but the seat's class designation remains. That's correct because the seat's class is a physical attribute. Swapping the bookings means the passengers are taking each other's seats, including their classes.

So the code handles this correctly.

Another edge case: swapping a seat with itself. The code would find both indices as the same and return false because swapping the same seat is unnecessary but technically allowed. Wait, no. If you try to swap seat 1A with 1A, the code will find both seats as the same, but in the loop, index1 and index2 will be the same. Then, check status. If it's reserved or occupied, proceed to swap. But swapping would replace the seat's reservation with itself. Not harmful, but perhaps the code should check if the two seats are different.

So in the swapSeats method:

if (row1 == row2 && seatLetter1.equalsIgnoreCase(seatLetter2)) {

return false; // same seat

}

Add this check after finding the indices.

Also, handle cases where a seat is blocked. Blocked seats cannot be swapped.

So in the status check:

if (seat1.getStatus() != seat2.getStatus() || (seat1.getStatus() != SeatStatus.RESERVED && seat1.getStatus() != SeatStatus.OCCUPIED)) {

return false;

}

Wait, the code currently checks if both statuses are the same, and then if they are RESERVED or OCCUPIED. Wait, no. The code first checks if the statuses are equal. Then, if they are RESERVED, swap reservations; if OCCUPIED, swap bookings. But what if one is RESERVED and the other OCCUPIED? The initial check for status equality would have failed, so return false.

So the code correctly handles that.

Now, testing the code:

Test case 1: Swap two reserved seats. Should swap their reservations.

Test case 2: Swap two occupied seats. Should swap bookings.

Test case 3: Swap reserved and occupied. Should fail.

Test case 4: Swap with one seat not existing. Should fail.

Test case 5: Swap same seat. Should fail.

So the code should handle these cases.

Now, in the FlightSeatManagerApp, the swapSeats method prompts for both seats and calls the swap method. Then logs success or failure.

Potential issues:

- Input handling: The scanner might have leftover newlines. Using nextInt() and next() can cause issues if not properly consumed. The current code uses scanner.nextLine() after nextInt() and next() to consume the newline, which should handle it.

- Seat existence: The swap method checks if both seats exist.

Now, adding the code as per the above.


# Answer

To implement seat swapping while maintaining data integrity, we enhance the system to handle both reserved and occupied seats. Here's the concise solution:

Key Changes
Add Swap Method in SeatPlan
Handles reservation/booking transfers between seats of matching statuses.

New Menu Option
Guides staff through seat selection and provides clear feedback.

... CODE ...

How It Works
Status Validation
Only allows swapping between seats with identical statuses (both reserved or both occupied)

Data Transfer

Reserved seats: Swap Reservation records while keeping seat classes

Occupied seats: Swap Booking records between seats

Safety Checks

Prevents self-swaps (same seat)

Validates seat existence before modification

Maintains immutable seat objects for thread safety

This implementation allows passengers to exchange seats while preserving all business rules and audit trails.
